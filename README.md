# critical-ops-0day
source to ban any account in mobile game called critical ops
# How it works
Uses critical ops private api to send reports to account after 30 reports the account should be 100% banned for 2 days. 
Uses Authorization cookie (something like temporary account token) to report account. 
Each "Token" is each account you can get them by logging requests when u play.
